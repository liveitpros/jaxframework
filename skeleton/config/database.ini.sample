; (which in turn controls the database vendor), and connection parameters.
; If you're using MySQL on the local machine with the default user and password,
; there will be no need to edit this file.

; This controls which connection class to use.
; The connection class must match the database type (vendor) you're running.
; Uncomment only one connectionClass value.
