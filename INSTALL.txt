Jax Framework -- General installation instructions.

This document assumes you're running Linux (Fedora 12, Ubuntu 11.04) or similar.
Adjust accordingly to your distro.

If you're going to use the MySQL database, read the MYSQL.txt document and follow its instructions to do any required special MySQL initial configuration.

If you're going to use the PostgreSQL database, read the PGSQL.txt document and follow its instructions to do any required special PostgreSQL initial configuration.

This package should be installed on a server machine, and accessed using a browser.

Copy the initial framework skeleton into place:
    cp -rp skeleton/* .

Configure the database connection:
    cp -p config/database.ini.sample config/database.ini
Edit config/database.ini.  Make any changes to the database connection parameters.
Keep in mind that whatever you specify for the user, password and database in this file, that
is how these entities will be created in the next step.  In most cases, if you're using MySQL,
you can probably leave this file as-is for a starting point.

Initialize the database.  This will create the user you specified in config/database.ini, assign
the password you specified, and create and initialize the database name you specified:
    ddl/initdb

Generate the initial DAO classes for the framework tables:
    ddl/regenDAO

Create the search, loader and CRUD scripts for the framework tables:
    gen/searchgen ; gen/crudgen

For Red Hat derivative Linux distributions, copy jax.conf.sample to /etc/httpd/conf.d/jax.conf and then edit the file at /etc/httpd/conf.d/jax.conf.  Adjust the path to point to where you installed jaxframework directory.  For Debian derivative linux distributions, this copy the file into /etc/apache2/sites-available, customize it there, then use "a2ensite jax.conf" to enable the site.

When you're done, be sure to restart (or reload) apache.

Edit /etc/hosts.  Find the localhost entry (127.0.0.1), and add "jax" (no quotes) to the end of the line, separated from the rest of the line by a tab character.

Point a browser to http://jax and login using username admin password admin.

To familiarize yourself with Jax Framework, point your browser to file://path/jaxframework/doc/guide/html/index.html (replace path with the path to the parent directory of jaxframework).

NOTE: To improve the speed of your project, turn on GZIP compression of output for browsers which
support it.
Edit /etc/php.ini.  Set zlib.output_compression = On.
Optionally set zlib.output_compression_level to a number between 1 and 9, inclusive.
1 = fastest but worst compression; 9 = slowest but best compression.
Or, you can leave zlib.output_compression_level at its default of -1 to let the server figure out
the best compression level.
